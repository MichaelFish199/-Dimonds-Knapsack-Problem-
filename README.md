In this notebook, we will explore how to solve the knapsack problem using Linear Programming from pulp library in Python. We will start by loading cpecific columns from our data such as carats and price. Then we will preprocess the data by searching for any inconsistancies, converting carats to kilograms and checking the weight of all gemstones. In the end we will use pulp library to search for optimal selection of items for out knapsack.
