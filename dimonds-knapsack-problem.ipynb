    "The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items to pack into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity, while maximizing the total value of the selected items.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore how to solve the knapsack problem using Linear Programming from pulp library in Python. We will start by loading cpecific columns from our data such as carats and price. Then we will preprocess the data by searching for any inconsistancies, converting carats to kilograms and checking the weight of all gemstones. In the end we will use pulp library to search for optimal selection of items for out knapsack."

    "In this notebook, we explored how to solve the classic optimization problem of the knapsack problem using Linear Programming from the pulp library in Python. We started by loading specific columns from our dataset, preprocessing the data by converting carats to kilograms and checking for any inconsistencies. We then defined the maximum weight of the knapsack and imported necessary modules to solve our problem. We defined the weights and values of the items, created a PuLP maximization problem, defined decision variables, and the objective function, and added a constraint for the knapsack capacity. Finally, we solved the problem and printed the solution, showing the selected items and their total value and weight.\n",

    "Overall, this notebook provides a clear demonstration of how to use Linear Programming to solve the knapsack problem, which is a common optimization problem in computer science and operations research. I hope code is well-commented and it is easy to understand the steps involved in the solution."
